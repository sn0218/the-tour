## Description

The Tour is a fully-fledged web application designed for persons who love travelling and provides an online platform for them to explore and book sightseeing tours. A sightseeing tour takes tourists on a themed adventure by visiting different locations. A visiting user who does not have an account on the app can view all the tours and detailed information about each tour. Once registered or logged in, an authenticated user can book any tour that they desire. An authenticated user can also write a review and give a rating to the tour.
